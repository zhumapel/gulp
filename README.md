# Gulp Build Tool - Web Development Workflow

This Gulp build tool provides a streamlined development workflow for web applications. It leverages Gulp to automate common tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying HTML, moving JavaScript files, and live-reloading the browser for real-time updates.

## Features

- **SCSS Compilation**: Automatically compile SCSS source files into CSS, handling errors and generating minified styles.
- **HTML Minification**: Minify HTML files by removing unnecessary white spaces and line breaks, improving performance and page load times.
- **File Movement**: Move JavaScript files, including main application files and library files, to the target directory for use in the project.
- **Live Browser Reload**: Automatically refresh the browser whenever changes are made to the source files, allowing instant feedback without manual page refresh.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with this Gulp build tool:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.
   ```
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure paths**: Update the `paths` object in the `gulpfile.js` file to match your project's directory structure.

4. **Run the build**: Start the Gulp build process by running the default task.
   ```
   gulp
   ```

5. **Development**: As you make changes to the source files, Gulp will automatically compile SCSS, minify HTML, move JavaScript files, and reload the browser for real-time updates.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Gulp build according to your specific requirements. You can modify the `gulpfile.js` file to add or remove tasks, configure additional file processing, or include other plugins to enhance your development workflow.

This is the complete folder and file structure for our Gulp build. The `src` folder contains all the source files that will be processed by Gulp. The output of the processing, such as compiled styles, moved JavaScript files, optimized images, and assembled font files, is stored in the `dist` folder.

You can customize the folder structure further according to your needs and add other folders or files to the project.
