# Gulp Build Tool - Web Development Workflow

This Gulp build tool provides a streamlined development workflow for web applications. It leverages Gulp to automate common tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying HTML, moving JavaScript files, and live-reloading the browser for real-time updates.

## Features

- **SCSS Compilation**: Automatically compile SCSS source files into CSS, handling errors and generating minified styles.
- **HTML Minification**: Minify HTML files by removing unnecessary white spaces and line breaks, improving performance and page load times.
- **File Movement**: Move JavaScript files, including main application files and library files, to the target directory for use in the project.
- **Live Browser Reload**: Automatically refresh the browser whenever changes are made to the source files, allowing instant feedback without manual page refresh.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with this Gulp build tool:

1. **Clone the repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.
   ```
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure paths**: Update the `paths` object in the `gulpfile.js` file to match your project's directory structure.

4. **Run the build**: Start the Gulp build process by running the default task.
   ```
   gulp
   ```

5. **Development**: As you make changes to the source files, Gulp will automatically compile SCSS, minify HTML, move JavaScript files, and reload the browser for real-time updates.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the Gulp build according to your specific requirements. You can modify the `gulpfile.js` file to add or remove tasks, configure additional file processing, or include other plugins to enhance your development workflow.
